Dory
====

Dory is a **Python3.7+** out-of-the box smart cache library.   
It simplifies multiple cache features and brings [Bloats](#Bloats) to the table, a tool designed to make smarter your application cache.

## Installation

Installation is as simple as:

```bash
pip install dory-cache
```

## Features

### Cache utils

Dory implements several cache utilities with a simple interface. For example, a decorator to cache views comfortably:

```python
@blueprint.get('/foo')
@dory.cache(key='foo', timeout=timedelta(hours=1))
def foo(request):
    """
    Render a Foo
    """
    ...

```

### Bloats üê°

</p>

<br>

For example, let's pretend that we have a model called `Product` wich can be either renderizer or edited.  

```python
class Product(Model):
    """
    Store information about a Product
    """
    id: int = PrimaryKey()
    name: str = Text()
    description: str = Text()
```

So, to improve the `Product` performance we cache the `Product` serialization view *(GET /product)*.

```python
@api.get('/product/<id>')
@dory.cache(key=lambda request, id: "product:%s" % id, timeout=timedelta(hours=1))
def get_product(request, id):
    """
    Serialize a Product
    """
    ...
```

Now everything works faster and as expected, but we did not contemplate that since the `Product` can be edited *(POST /product)*, we could have cached an outdated version of the `Product`, so we need a way to force the cache to refresh itself. This is where **Bloats** come in handy!  

Instead of caching the view with a custom key, decouple the cache logic on a `Bloat`:

```python
class Product(dory.Bloat):
    """
    Product's bloat
    """
    prefix: str = 'product'
    key: str
    
    timeout: timedelta = timedelta(hours=1)
    enabled: bool = True
    
    def __init__(product_id: int):
        self.key = '%s' % product_id
```

```python
@api.get('/product/<id>')
@bloats.Product.cache(args=lambda request, id: dict(product_id=id))
def get_product(request, id):
    """
    Serialize a Product
    """
    ...
```

And now, when a `Product` is edited, you can force the view to refresh the cache using the defined `Bloat` as a middle-man.

```python
@api.post('/product/<id>')
def edit_product(request, id):
    """
    Edit a Product
    """
    # edit the product
    services.product.edit(request.body)
    # clean up outdated cache
    bloats.Product(product_id=id).deflate()
```

Now your cache will always be in sync and it'll be configured in a cleaner way! üî•
