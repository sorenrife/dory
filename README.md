`Bloats` responds to the need of having a simpler approach on designing reactive cache on your system. `Bloats` make cache configuration and management easy.


For example, let's pretend that we have a model called `Product` which can be either serialized or edited. So, to improve the `Product` serialization performance we cache the `Product` serialization view **(GET /product/<id>)**.

```python
from dory.cache import cache
from dory.utils import F

@api.get('/product/<product_id>')
@cache(prefix='product', key=F('product_id'), timeout=timedelta(hours=1))
def get_product(request, product_id):
    """
    Serialize a Product
    """
    ...
```

Now everything works faster and as expected, but we did not contemplate that since the `Product` can be edited **(PUT /product/<id>)**, we could have cached an outdated version of the `Product`, so we need a way to force the cache to refresh itself. This is where **Bloats** come in handy!

Instead of caching the view with a generic cache decorator, decouple the cache configuration on a `Bloat`:

```python
from dory.bloats import Bloat, Field

class Product(Bloat):
    """
    Product's bloat
    """
    product_id: int = Field(...)
    
    timeout: timedelta = timedelta(hours=1)
    enabled: bool = True
```

```python
from dory.bloats.utils import F, cache

@api.get('/product/<product_id>')
@cache(Product(product_id=F('product_id')))
def get_product(request, product_id):
    """
    Serialize a Product
    """
    ...
```

And now, when a `Product` is edited, you can force the view to refresh the cache using the `Bloat` as a middle-man.

```python
from dory.bloats.utils import F, destroy

@api.put('/product/<product_id>')
@destroy(Product(product_id=F('product_id')))
def edit_product(request, product_id):
    """
    Edit a Product
    """
    ...
```

Now your cache will always be in sync and it'll be configured in a cleaner way! üî•

### Cache utils

**Dory** simplifies several cache utilities with an out-of-the-box interface. For example, a decorator to cache views comfortably:

```python
from dory.cache import cache
from dory.utils import F

@api.get('/foo')
@cache(prefix='foo', key=F('foo_id'), timeout=timedelta(hours=1))
def foo(request, foo_id):
    """
    Render a Foo
    """
    ...
```

### Django signals

The [Django signals](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/signals/) will permit the Bloats to expire themselves when a `post_save` signal from the Bloat's Django designated model signal is sent.

```python
from dory import bloats
from .api import models

class Product(bloats.Bloat):
    """
    Product's bloat
    """
    ...

    class Meta:
        django_model = models.Product
```

```python
from dory.utils import F

@api.get('/product/<product_id>')
@cache(Product(product_id=F('product_id')))
def get_product(request, product_id):
    """
    Serialize a Product
    """
    ...
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] **Bloats üê°** (See [Bloats](#Bloats))
- [ ] **Cache utils** (See [Cache utils](#Cache-utils))
    - [ ] **Cache decorator**   
    - [ ] **Ratelimit**
- [ ] **Django signals** (See [Django signals](#Django-signals))
- [ ] **Bloats v2**
    - The v2 of the `Bloats` will implement the method `.set()`, capable not only to deprecate the current `Bloat` version, but to fill it it again. The design is still a `WIP`.
- [ ] **Support more cache engines**
